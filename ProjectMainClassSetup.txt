Detailed Breakdown of the Main Function (Main Class)
The Main class acts as the entry point of the application, providing a menu-driven interface to interact with the library system. Here's how it works in detail:

=>Setup:

The main method creates an instance of the Library class and a Scanner for reading user input.
A loop (while (!exit)) runs continuously until the user chooses to exit.

=>Menu Display:
The menu is displayed to the user with options to perform various operations (add, remove, search, display, save, load, exit).

=>User Input:
The program waits for the user to choose an option and reads the input.
=>Switch Case:
-A switch statement handles the user's choice:
-Add a Book: Prompts the user for book details and adds the book to the library.
-Remove a Book: Prompts the user for the ISBN of the book to remove.
-Search for a Book by Title: Prompts the user for the book title to search.
-Display All Books: Retrieves and displays all books in the library.
-Save Library to File: Prompts the user for a filename and saves the library data to that file.
-Load Library from File: Prompts the user for a filename and loads the library data from that file.
-Exit: Sets the exit flag to true to terminate the loop and end the program.

=>Error Handling:
The program includes error handling for file operations, catching IOException and ClassNotFoundException during save and load operations.
