1. Compile the Classes :
First, you need to compile the Java files to generate the corresponding bytecode files. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your .java files are located. 
Then run: `javac Book.java Library.java Main.java`
This command compiles the Java files and creates `.class` files for each of them.

2. Run the Program
Once the compilation is successful, you can run the Main class which contains the main method.
Use the following command: `java Main`
